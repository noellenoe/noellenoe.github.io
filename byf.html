      <h3>BYI!</h3>
      <p>I am an adult, but that does not mean i'm inherently ok with being sent NSFW, I do not want to see that stuff! I will sometimes just generally not be online, if I dont answer your message within like an hour, just dm me again, but please don't spam, I'm probably working on something or napping. If i don't answer you <i>again</i> after you dm me, please do not assume I'm ignoring you, if I was ignoring you, you'd be blocked. Please use tone indicators with me, I find them very helpful, even if you do not. Please ask before you vent to me, I'm very open to being vented to but I sometimes can't handle it, so please ask and respect if i say no and wait until later. <b>DO NOT BABY ME</b>, that pisses me off a lot and probably will block you. I am often jokingly mean to my friends, please let me know if that is something you don't like, and in general if I do something you don't like please let me know. I'm very loud, if you have audio sensitivity either turn me down in vc or <b>politely</b> tell me to be more quite, I also will verbally stim if i'm comfy around you. I post whatever I'm hyperfixated on at that moment, right now that's; Pokémon before gen 9/SV (specifically 1st and 8th gen), Kirby, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Euphoria, Dreamworks in general, The Owl House, Resident Evil, and Moominvalley.
